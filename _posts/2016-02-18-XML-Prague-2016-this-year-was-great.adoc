= XML Prague 2016 this year was great

I left this years http://www.xmlprague.cz[conference] brimming with energy and excited for the year to come.

All the talks were of a high standard and I would recommend checking out the proceedings and related presentations/code.

A few talks sparked my interest.

* Romain Deltour's double barrel of EPUB ()

* Michael Kay's XSLT 3.0 compiled stylesheets in JS

* James Wrights XQuery promises

* Charles Greer pulling at the entities and relationships in a document database

* George Bina's reprisal of Magic URLs
