= Thanks Kurt for the (re)memories ...

I read most of Kurt Vonnegut's books as a young teenager. 

Over the years I often return to them - mostly for pure entertainment but often I prise new little gems of understanding. Lets be clear, Kurt is no Goethe and while he himself despised to be put into the category of 'science fiction' often the topics he wrote about were framed within 'science fiction'.

This year he reminds us that *technocracy* is not the solution we are seeking
