        <section class="post-content">
            <div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A surprising number of people have asked me the question:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>'Why did you give up the @XQuery twitter account ?'</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So many that maybe I should reiterate the reasons why here.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_time_and_space">Time and space</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Admittedly, it takes very little time to maintain any twitter account. Even so every year I do a 'spring cleaning' (sic: in January) and reallocate my time commitments. However big or small I make a list of my commitments then decide where I would like to spend my open source time as contrasted to everything else I do (Life, Work, etc).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last year I wanted to invest some time refreshing myself in c/cplusplus++11/14 which makes c/cplusplus interesting again (CLANG, llvm, fp). Breaking off this 'rust' lets me efficiently apply some ideas to some new open source projects as well as learn from other genius works (<a href="http://xqilla.sourceforge.net/HomePage">XQilla</a>, etc).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_xquery_is_my_language_of_choice">XQuery is my language of choice</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At my <a href="http://developer.marklogic.com">day job</a> I sling XQuery all day, every day - I feel very lucky to be able to work on something that also happens to be one of my passions and I hope that remains the same for many years to come.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Latest versions of the language (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/">XQuery 3.1</a>) make me even more excited for its future (maps/arrays, annotations and even the humble arrow operator).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That being from time to time I find myself 'looking over the fence' at other programming languages. Like many programmers, I&#8217;ve always worked in a few languages, here&#8217;s my list of languages that I am uptodate on (though not an expert!): XQuery, Java, python, c, javascript, emacs lisp and Perl(6). Sometimes I&#8217;ve had to learn them out of some short term need, sometimes my curiosity (or boredeom) inspires me to learn more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a few months ago when using <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> I wondered why things were so fast in a certain situation; docker is written in Go and I learned that maps in Go are not thread safe (!) which was answer enough for this newbie but asking that question led me to the definition of   <a href="https://gobyexample.com/goroutines">goroutines</a> which are interesting grist for the concurrency mill.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So while I think its important to avoid becoming a <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-magpie-developer/">magpie developer</a> that doesn&#8217;t mean we should avoid regular small investigations in other languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many of the good things that have happened to me in programming often were preceded by 'little investigations' though its important to learn how to timebox your efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, learning idioms or better ways to do something in one language often help one become a better programmer in another.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_avoiding_sentimentality_in_software">Avoiding sentimentality in software</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you work long enough in the software industry eventually you will experience the thrill of your favourite language coming into favour as well as the despair when it falls out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Doing a regular moral inventory of what open software projects I work on allows me to gauge sentimality - holding onto 'precious' only because of previous commitment sunk can be a sign that you are in an evolutionary 'dead end'. I do not think this is the case with XQuery, yes its a boutique language that works within the XML technology stack, but it also plays nice with text and now with other data formats (json, semantics, etc&#8230;&#8203;). I believe we should embrace diversity in programming and shudder at a future where we have a single paradigm for expression.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="__xquery_is_in_good_hands">@XQuery is in good hands</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/joewiz">@joewiz</a> stewardship of <a href="http://twitter.com/XQuery">@XQuery</a> has surpassed my paltry efforts and does a great job at being focused on xquery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would heartedly reccomend you follow <a href="http://twitter.com/XQuery">@XQuery</a> and contribute in the discussion.</p>
